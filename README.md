This is a great first week of school activity. Help your students get to know each other with this casual game. Students are engaged in rolling dice, and matching their roll to a corresponding question that they answer loud to their group. All you need is some dice. The live site can be found here https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/dicebreaker. Enjoy!
